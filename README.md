Snake: 

Building version of the snake game in python, using Pygame

🐍 Snake and Apple is a simple game where if snake eats an orange it gets longer and your score increases 1 point. If your snake hits any part of his body it will die
(you lose). The player controls the direction of the snake's head (up, down, right, left) with the arrow keys and the snake's body follows. The player can't stop the
snake's direction while the game is running.
